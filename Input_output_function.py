# The input & output means how a program recieves data (input) and how it shows or sends result (output)

# Output --- Output is used to print a information / value / data on the terminal. For printing the 
# output on the terminal the print() function is used which prints the output on terminal.
# Example ;
# print("Hello from Pritam Phadtare")

# Input --- Input is used to take the dynamic input values from the user and use it in the program. Here
# input() function is used for taking the input from user or systems.
# Example ;
# Taking name as an input ,
# input("Your Name Please: ") 

# The input taken from the user will be stored in the garbage memory as we are not declaring or storing
# it in a variable.

# If we want to store the input value in variable then simply add the input function as an value to a
# variable ,
# name = input("Your Name Please: ")
# age = input("Current Age: ")
# And if we want to print the value on the terminal then using the print function call or print the variable.
# print(name, age)
# print (f"Hello from {name} and age is {age}")
