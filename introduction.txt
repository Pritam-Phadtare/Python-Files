What is a Programming language ?
--> Programming language is a medium through which the human beings can communicate
with the machines and systems , as systems uses the machine language (Binary) which
is hard to decode for a normal person , so instead of using the binary language
we humans generally use the programming language as a medium to communicate with
machines.

Python origin --- The python programming language was invented by Guido van Rossum in
1980, where the python was designed as a successor to the ABC language which belived in 
simple readibility and and high level task. The name “Python” was inspired by the
British TV comedy series Monty Python’s Flying Circus, not the snake.
Python’s first public release happened in 1991 (early 1991, with versions in the 0.9.x range)

Python Working --- Python is an interpreted language, which say's whenever you run a .py file
1. The interpreter parses your source code and compiles into an intermediate form called bytecode.
2. That bytecode may be stored as a .pyc so next runs can skip recompiling when nothing changed.
3. The Python Virtual Machine (PVM) executes that bytecode instruction-by-instruction in an interpreter
loop.
