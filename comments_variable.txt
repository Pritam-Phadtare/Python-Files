Comments --- Comments are the notes which are written in the source code which is 
ignored by the python interpreter for the execution.
comments start with # and continues to the end of the line.
Python does not support multi-line comments but can be achieved using a doc string
"""multi-line""".

Variables --- Variables are names we use in a program to refer to data (values) so you
can reuse and change that data while the program runs.
Python variables are dynamically typed, meaning the same variable name can later be 
reassigned to a value of a different type (for example, an int first and then a str).

For example :
name = pritam
age = 20

Here, name is a variable which holds the value "pritam", and age is also a variable which
holds the value "20"

Rule's for Variable name :
1. Variable name cannot start with the numbers.
2. Variable name cannot have spaces between them.
3. Variable name cannot have special characters.
4. Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age, AGE are different).
5. Reserved Keywords cannot be using for naming variables (36 Keywords)

Naming Conventions for variable :
1. Camel case - pritamPhadtare
2. Pascal case - PritamPhadtare
3. Snake case - pritam_phadtare
